# C Programming Learning Practices

Welcome to my C programming learning journey! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress and exercises as I dive into the world of C programming.

## Introduction

As a beginner in C programming, I'm excited to explore the foundations of this versatile language and build a strong programming foundation. This repository serves as a virtual journal where I record my learning experiences, challenges, and accomplishments.

## Learning Approach

My approach to learning C involves a blend of theory and hands-on practice. I aim to grasp essential concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and pointers before tackling more advanced topics like memory management, file handling, and data structures.

## Repository Structure

### Basics

- Variables and data types
- Operators
- Control structures (if statements, loops)
- Functions

### Pointers and Memory Management

- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc, free)
- Memory leaks and memory management techniques


Happy coding!
